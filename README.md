## About Me
An aspiring web developer born and raised in Massachusetts, I moved to the Pacific Northwest in 2017. With over 15 years of professional experience in audio-visual production and project management, I decided to expand my skillset to include full-stack web development. I'm incredibly excited about this journey, and I hope you share it with me!
